# kaggle-mini-project 
In this project, I used data from kaggle datasets to analyse the impact of the level of parental education on students performance. 
I visualized the analyses using Seaborn visualization sns.barplot to visualise my data. 
The plot shows a very little impact of the parental education on the students performance. 
The mean  maths score of the students were used for this analysis.
